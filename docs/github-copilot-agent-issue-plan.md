# GitHub Copilot Agent Issue Plan - Raspberry Pi MCP Server

## Document Purpose

This document provides a strategic breakdown of Phase 1 implementation into GitHub Issues optimized for GitHub Copilot Agent's **6-hour maximum runtime limit**. Each issue is designed to be a cohesive, completeable unit of work within a single 6-hour session.

**Target Audience**: GitHub Copilot Agent (AI developer) + Human project manager

---

## Strategy Overview

### Design Principles

1. **6-Hour Optimization**: Each issue targets 5-6 hours of work, leaving buffer for debugging and testing
2. **Dependency-Aware**: Issues are sequenced to respect dependencies (Core → Security → Tools)
3. **Self-Contained**: Each issue includes all context needed (design doc references, acceptance criteria)
4. **Test-Inclusive**: All issues include unit test requirements (TDD approach)
5. **Hardware-Separated**: Hardware-dependent features grouped to minimize context switching

### Effort Mapping to 6-Hour Sessions

From [phase-1-scope-matrix.md](phase-1-scope-matrix.md):
- **XS (1-3h)**: Bundle 2-3 XS features per issue
- **S (4-8h)**: 1 S feature per issue (ideal fit)
- **M (1-2 days)**: Split into 2 issues or pair with XS features
- **L (3-5 days)**: Split into 3-4 issues with clear milestones
- **XL (1-2 weeks)**: Split into 5-7 issues with incremental delivery

### Issue Sequencing

**Critical Path** (must be sequential):
1. Core Infrastructure (Issues #1-3) → ~3 sessions
2. Security Foundation (Issue #4) → ~1 session
3. Basic Tools (Issues #5-6) → ~2 sessions
4. Advanced Features (Issues #7-10) → ~4 sessions

**Parallel Opportunities**: After Issue #4, Issues #5-8 can be worked in any order.

## Quick Start Example

Here's how to create Issue #1 with GitHub Copilot Agent:

1. **Go to GitHub** → Your repository → Issues → New Issue

2. **Set Title**:
   ```
   [Phase 1] Project Foundation & Configuration System
   ```

3. **Paste Issue Description** (from Issue #1 below - the "📋 Issue Description" section)

4. **Add Labels**: `copilot-agent`, `phase-1`, `effort-6h`, `complexity-medium`

5. **Assign to GitHub Copilot Agent**:
   - Click "Assign" button
   - Select "GitHub Copilot Agent" from dropdown
   - In the **"Custom Prompt"** field, paste the entire "🤖 GitHub Copilot Agent Custom Prompt" section from Issue #1 below

6. **Submit** and monitor progress!

GitHub Copilot Agent will:
- Read the custom prompt
- Read all referenced design documents
- Implement the feature
- Run tests and linting
- Commit code with descriptive messages
- Post status updates to the issue

---

## GitHub Issue Structure

Each GitHub issue has three distinct parts:

### 1. **Title** (One Line)
Example: `[Phase 1] Project Foundation & Configuration System`

### 2. **Description** (Issue Body - For Human Review)
The main issue description contains:
- Scope and deliverables
- Acceptance criteria
- Design document references
- Human review checklist
- Implementation notes

This is what humans see when reviewing the issue and tracking progress.

### 3. **GitHub Copilot Agent Custom Prompt** (Separate Field)
When assigning the issue to GitHub Copilot Agent, you provide a custom prompt that:
- Gives context about the project
- Lists specific design documents to read
- Specifies implementation requirements
- Provides development process steps
- Defines success criteria

**Important**: The custom prompt is entered in a separate field when assigning to Copilot Agent, NOT in the issue description.

### How to Create an Issue with Copilot Agent

1. **Create GitHub Issue**:
   - Use the title from the issue specification below
   - Copy the "Issue Description" section as the issue body
   - Add labels: `copilot-agent`, `phase-1`, `effort-<hours>`, `complexity-<level>`
   - Link dependencies if applicable

2. **Assign to GitHub Copilot Agent**:
   - Click "Assign" → Select GitHub Copilot Agent
   - In the **"Custom Prompt"** field, paste the "Copilot Agent Custom Prompt" from the issue specification
   - Submit the assignment

3. **Monitor Progress**:
   - Copilot Agent will comment on the issue with status updates
   - Review commits and test results as they're posted
   - Provide feedback if needed

- Design docs are in docs/ directory - read thoroughly
- Standards: TDD, ≥85% test coverage, type hints, security best practices
- Tools: JWT (PyJWT), JWKS, Pydantic, structured logging
- Time limit: 6 hours for this issue

DESIGN DOCUMENTS TO READ:
- docs/04-security-oauth-integration-and-access-control-design.md (COMPLETE security design)
- docs/05-mcp-tools-interface-and-json-schema-specification.md §1.3 (ToolContext)
- docs/09-logging-observability-and-diagnostics-design.md §4 (Audit Logging)

DELIVERABLES:
1. JWT validation: extract from MCP headers, verify signature via JWKS
2. JWKS fetching: download and cache Cloudflare's public keys
3. RBAC roles: viewer, operator, admin with @require_role decorator
4. ToolContext population: user_id, email, roles from JWT claims
5. Policy enforcement: check role requirements before tool execution
6. Audit logging: structured logs for all privileged operations
7. Local auth mode: static token or permissive mode for dev/testing
8. Configuration: auth_mode (cloudflare|local), JWKS URL, allowed roles
9. Unit tests with mocked JWT/JWKS endpoints

EXPECTED FILE STRUCTURE:
```python
src/mcp_raspi/security/
  __init__.py
  jwt_validator.py      # JWTValidator class
  jwks_fetcher.py       # JWKSFetcher class, caching logic
  rbac.py               # @require_role decorator, role checks
  audit_logger.py       # AuditLogger class
tests/
  test_jwt_validator.py
  test_jwks_fetcher.py
  test_rbac.py
  test_audit_logger.py
```

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (ALL MUST PASS):
- Valid Cloudflare JWT authenticates user and extracts roles
- Invalid/expired JWT rejected with proper error (4002 Permission denied)
- Tools enforce role requirements (e.g., admin only for reboot)
- Audit logs contain: timestamp, user, action, result, parameters
- Local auth mode bypasses JWT validation (for dev/testing)
- JWKS keys cached and refreshed on expiry
- All tests pass with mocked JWT/JWKS endpoints
- Test coverage ≥85% on security module

ROLE PERMISSIONS (from Doc 04 §5):
- viewer: Read-only (system.get_*, metrics.query, logs.get_*)
- operator: viewer + device control (gpio.*, i2c.*, service.control_service)
- admin: Full access (system.reboot, system.shutdown, manage.update_server)

JWT CLAIMS MAPPING:
- sub → user_id
- email → email
- groups/roles → roles (array of strings)

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS:
1. Read Doc 04 completely - security is critical
2. Implement JWTValidator with PyJWT library
3. Implement JWKSFetcher with caching (TTL from JWKS header)
4. Create @require_role decorator for RBAC
5. Implement AuditLogger with structured JSON logging
6. Add local auth mode for development
7. Integrate with ToolContext (from Issue #2)
8. Write comprehensive tests with mocked JWT/JWKS
9. Test invalid tokens, expired tokens, missing roles
10. Run `uv run pytest --cov` - must pass ≥85% coverage
11. Run `uv run ruff check` - zero errors

CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
- MUST verify JWT signature using JWKS public keys
- MUST check token expiration (exp claim)
- MUST validate issuer (iss claim) matches Cloudflare
- MUST reject tokens without required roles
- Audit logs MUST be tamper-evident (append-only)
- NEVER log sensitive data (tokens, passwords) in audit logs
- Local auth mode ONLY for development, NEVER in production

AUDIT LOG FORMAT (JSON):
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T14:30:00Z",
  "user_id": "user@example.com",
  "action": "system.reboot",
  "result": "success|failure",
  "params": {...},
  "role": "admin"
}

WHEN COMPLETE:
- Post implementation summary to this issue
- Post test coverage report
- Demonstrate JWT validation working with mock tokens
- Show RBAC enforcement working
- Show audit logs being generated
- Mark ready for human review

IF STUCK:
- Review Doc 04 for complete security specifications
- Start with simplest JWT validation first
- Mock JWKS endpoint in tests
- If approaching 6-hour limit, document progress and stop

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
All acceptance criteria met. This security foundation is CRITICAL - all future issues depend on proper authentication and authorization.

2. **Add Labels**: `copilot-agent`, `phase-1`, `effort:<hours>`, `complexity:<level>`
3. **Set Dependencies**: Link dependent issues ("depends on #N")
4. **Assign to Copilot**: Use `@copilot` or GitHub Copilot Agent workflow trigger
5. **Monitor Progress**: Copilot Agent will update issue with status/comments

### Copilot Agent Instructions

Include this in each issue description:

```markdown
## Instructions for GitHub Copilot Agent

**Estimated Time**: 5-6 hours
**Design Documents**: [See "Design Documents" section above]
**Dependencies**: [See "Dependencies" section above]

### Before Starting
1. Read linked design documents thoroughly
2. Understand acceptance criteria
3. Review dependencies (wait for prerequisite issues to complete)

### Development Process
1. **TDD Approach**: Write tests first, then implementation
2. **Follow Standards**: Use Python type hints, docstrings, follow Doc 13
3. **Incremental Commits**: Commit frequently with clear messages
4. **Run Tests**: `uv run pytest --cov` must pass with ≥85% coverage
5. **Lint Check**: `uv run ruff check` must pass with zero errors

### When Complete
1. Update this issue with summary of implementation
2. Post test coverage report
3. Highlight any deviations from design docs (with rationale)
4. Mark issue as complete
```

### Monitoring Copilot Agent

**Expected outputs from Copilot Agent**:
- Commits to feature branch (e.g., `copilot/issue-5-system-tools`)
- Test results posted to issue comments
- Coverage reports
- Status updates ("completed X, working on Y")
- Questions/clarifications (if design ambiguous)

**Human review triggers**:
- After each issue completes (code review)
- If Copilot Agent gets stuck (timeout > 30 minutes)
- For hardware testing (Issues #6, #9)
- Before deployment (Issue #12)

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Issues

| Issue | Risk | Mitigation |
|-------|------|------------|
| **#3** | IPC complexity | Extra testing, consider simpler protocol if needed |
| **#4** | Security bugs | Security-focused code review, penetration testing |
| **#6** | Hardware dependencies | Use mocks extensively, hardware tests optional |
| **#11** | Update/rollback failure | Extensive E2E testing, manual validation required |

### Fallback Plans

**If 6-hour limit exceeded**:
- Split issue into smaller parts (Part 1, Part 2)
- Defer non-critical acceptance criteria to later issue
- Simplify implementation (mark as "basic implementation")

**If dependencies block progress**:
- Work on independent issues (#5-9 can be done in any order after #4)
- Create mock implementations of dependencies for testing

**If hardware unavailable**:
- Use GPIO/I2C/Camera mocks (already in plan)
- Document hardware validation steps for manual testing
- Mark as "tested with mocks, needs hardware validation"
